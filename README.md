# ListOfCountries
A Swift-based iOS application that fetches and displays a list of countries with powerful features such as **search**, **filtering**, and **dynamic view modes** (Grid/List). This project uses **MVVM architecture** and is built with testability and clean design principles in mind.

---

## Features

- Display all countries in either **List View** or **Grid View**
- Real-time **search functionality**
- Filter countries by specific criteria (region, name, etc.)
- Fetch data using **API layer** with proper error handling
- Modular architecture with **ViewModel**, **Model**, and **Networking** layers
- Unit Tests and UI Tests for robustness

---

## Architecture

This project follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern.

```
Model ⟶ ViewModel ⟶ ViewController
  ↑          ↓           ↓
Network    Filtering    UI Updates
Layer      + Binding
```

### Model
- `CountryModel.swift`: Represents the structure of each country including name, region, flags, etc.

### ViewModel
- `CountriesListViewModel.swift`: Handles data fetching, search logic, filtering, and exposes observable properties for the view to update reactively.

### Views
- `CountriesListViewController.swift`: UI controller responsible for displaying data and managing the list/grid toggle.
- `CountriesListTableViewCell.swift`: Cell used for **List View**.
- `CountriesListCollectiveViewCell.swift`: Cell used for **Grid View**.

### Networking
- `APIManager.swift`: Handles all API requests using `URLSession`.
- `APIEndpoints.swift`: Centralized definition of API endpoint URLs.
- `APIManagerProtocol.swift`: Protocol to abstract the API manager for easier testing.
- `NetworkError.swift`: Enum for categorizing network errors.

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- `CountriesListViewModelTests.swift`: Tests for view model logic like search, filtering, and parsing.
- `APIManagerTests.swift`: Tests for API request and response handling with mocks.

### Mocking
- `MockURLProtocol.swift`: Intercepts and simulates API responses for unit tests.
- `MockAPIManager.swift`: Mock implementation of `APIManagerProtocol`.

### UI Tests
- `ListOfCountriesUITests.swift`
- `ListOfCountriesUITestsLaunchTests.swift`

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 13 or higher
- iOS 13.0+
- Swift 5.5+

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ListOfCountries.git
   cd ListOfCountries
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open ListOfCountries.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Run the app on the simulator or a connected device.

---

## View Mode

You can switch between:
- **List View** – vertical scrolling list with country details.
- **Grid View** – a grid layout with country cards.

This is managed through an enum:
```swift
enum ViewMode {
    case list
    case grid
}
```

The toggle is implemented in `CountriesListViewController.swift`, and the UI refreshes accordingly.

---

## Search & Filter

- Users can type in a search bar to filter countries by name.
- ViewModel updates results in real time using reactive bindings or delegate updates.

Like:
```swift
func searchCountries(keyword: String) {
    filteredCountries = allCountries.filter {
        $0.name.lowercased().contains(keyword.lowercased())
    }
}
```
